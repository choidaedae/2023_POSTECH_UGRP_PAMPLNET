# POSTECH UGRP 2022 - Team PAMPLNET (Research Subject: A Study on the Extended PAMS System Using NFT) 

POSTECH UGRP is one of the meaningful activities in POSTECH, which undergraduates team up with POSTECH to proactively decide research topics and study them for a year.
Our team won the Grand Prize for a year of research under the theme Research Subject: <A Study on the Extended PAMS System Using NFT>, which improves some problems of PAMS (POSTECH Activity Management System) and implements our own system as an mobile application.
So I share you the source code of our app. It is based on the DART and Flutter framework, and used the Firestore database. I hope our work will be of great reference to you! Thank you.
